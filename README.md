# Hi there, I'm Tuna ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer engineering student with a passion for software development and a focus on frontend and backend development. I have a 3.64 GPA and have gained experience in various tools including React, Git, and Node.js. I've also had the opportunity to work on several interesting projects, including:

- [SolAuth](https://www.solauth.xyz/): Co-founder of a startup that provides secure and decentralized authentication services using blockchain technology.
- [World Cup Predictor](https://www.worldcup-predict.com/): A web application that allows users to predict the outcomes of World Cup matches and compete with others for prizes. Built with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
- [QRCode Lemon](https://www.qrcode-lemon.com/): A simple web application that generates QR codes for URLs. Built with React and Node.js.

In addition to these projects, I've also gained experience working with swarm intelligence algorithms for multi-drone systems during an internship at STM. I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills as a developer.
